"     │ This trait provides a comprehensive interface for data processing        "
"     │ operations. It demonstrates various method signatures including mutable  "
"     │ references, error handling, and different return types. The trait is     "
"     │ designed to be flexible and extensible for different use cases in data   "
"     │ processing pipelines. Each method serves a specific purpose in the data  "
"     │ transformation workflow. The implementation should handle edge cases     "
"     │ gracefully and provide meaningful error messages when operations fail.   "
"     │ This documentation intentionally spans many lines to test the            "
"     │ line-based truncation when paragraph truncation doesn't apply. We want   "
"     │ to see how the system handles documentation that goes well beyond the    "
"     │ 16-line limit and should trigger line-based truncation. This continues   "
"     │ for several more lines to ensure we exceed the limit. Line 14 of this    "
"     │ very long paragraph that should be truncated. Line 15 of this extremely  "
"     │ verbose documentation example. Line 16 which should be the last line     "
