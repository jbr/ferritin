Kind: Struct
Visibility: Public
Defined at: test_crate::TestStruct
In crate: test-crate (0.1.0)

A simple struct for testing basic functionality.

This struct demonstrates basic usage patterns and should show completely since it only has one paragraph of documentation.

It uses Vector for testing intra-doc link resolution with renamed imports. Also tests HashMap which is a non-renamed import.

struct TestStruct {
    pub field: String,
    pub count: u32,
}

Fields:

  ◦ field: String
    A public field

  ◦ count: u32
    Another public field

Associated Types

  ◦ pub const ASSOCIATED_CONST
    This is an associated constant for a struct

  ◦ pub fn new(field: String, count: u32) -> Self
    Create a new TestStruct

  ◦ pub fn get_field(&self) -> &str
    Get the field value

  ◦ pub fn increment_count(&mut self)
    Update the count
