"   Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted     "
"   document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like    "
"   it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown's   "
"   syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters --       "
"   including Setext, atx, Textile, reStructuredText, Grutatext, and EtText --   "
"   the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format "
"   of plain text email.                                                         "

"   A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by    "
"   one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank   "
"   line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.)   "
"   Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.                "
"                                                                                "
"   The implication of the "one or more consecutive lines of text" rule is that  "
"   Markdown supports "hard-wrapped" text paragraphs. This differs significantly "
"   from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type's "Convert   "
"   Line Breaks" option) which translate every line break character in a         "
"   paragraph into a <br /> tag.                                                 "
"                                                                                "
"   When you do want to insert a <br /> break tag using Markdown, you end a line "
"   with two or more spaces, then type return.                                   "
"                                                                                "
"   Headers                                                                      "

"   Markdown supports two styles of headers, Setext 1 and atx 2.                 "
"                                                                                "
"   Optionally, you may "close" atx-style headers. This is purely cosmetic --    "
"   you can use this if you think it looks better. The closing hashes don't even "
"   need to match the number of hashes used to open the header. (The number of   "
"   opening hashes determines the header level.)                                 "
