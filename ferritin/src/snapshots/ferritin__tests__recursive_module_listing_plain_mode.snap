    Creates a new empty String. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::pop 
    Removes the last character from the string buffer and returns it. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::push 
    Appends the given char to the end of this String. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::push_str 
    Appends a given string slice onto the end of this String. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::remove 
    Removes a char from this String at byte position idx and returns it. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::remove_matches 
    Remove all matches of pattern pat in the String. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::replace_first 
    Replaces the leftmost occurrence of a pattern with another string, in-place. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::replace_last 
    Replaces the rightmost occurrence of a pattern with another string, in-place. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::replace_range 
    Removes the specified range in the string, and replaces it with the given string. The given string doesn't need to be the same length as the range. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::reserve 
    Reserves capacity for at least additional bytes more than the current length. The allocator may reserve more space to speculatively avoid frequent allocations. After calling reserve, capacity will be greater than or equal to self.len() + additional. Does nothing if capacity is already sufficient. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::reserve_exact 
    Reserves the minimum capacity for at least additional bytes more than the current length. Unlike reserve, this will not deliberately over-allocate to speculatively avoid frequent allocations. After calling reserve_exact, capacity will be greater than or equal to self.len() + additional. Does nothing if the capacity is already sufficient. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::retain 
    Retains only the characters specified by the predicate. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::shrink_to 
    Shrinks the capacity of this String with a lower bound. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::shrink_to_fit 
    Shrinks the capacity of this String to match its length. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::split_off 
    Splits the string into two at the given byte index. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::truncate 
    Shortens this String to the specified length. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::try_reserve 
    Tries to reserve capacity for at least additional bytes more than the current length. The allocator may reserve more space to speculatively avoid frequent allocations. After calling try_reserve, capacity will be greater than or equal to self.len() + additional if it returns Ok(()). Does nothing if capacity is already sufficient. This method preserves the contents even if an error occurs. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::try_reserve_exact 
    Tries to reserve the minimum capacity for at least additional bytes more than the current length. Unlike try_reserve, this will not deliberately over-allocate to speculatively avoid frequent allocations. After calling try_reserve_exact, capacity will be greater than or equal to self.len() + additional if it returns Ok(()). Does nothing if the capacity is already sufficient. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::try_with_capacity 
    Creates a new empty String with at least the specified capacity. [...]

  ◦ link_resolution_tests::nested::Str::with_capacity 
    Creates a new empty String with at least the specified capacity. [...]
